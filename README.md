Ample food and clothing by working with our own hands. The help file that comes with Bongo2.0 is a good practice material. Here, I will share my practice experience and confusion with you, for everyone to learn and learn from.

I hope that with the joint efforts of everyone, the essence of this set of help files will be fully explored, and more people will like Bongo2.0 animation.

Due to my limited level, I am also exploring and learning. Welcome everyone to actively post messages.

## Learning together
With such a good platform, you should show yourself to the fullest. You can try to create themes and post by yourself. if you don't try it, how will you know that you are a potential stock.

Of course, you can alse directly continue and improve my post. It dosen't matter who posted it, as long as it is helpful for learning, there is no problem at all, just take it directly.

There are no restrictions on cooking methods and ingredients, and you can make a work that you are proud of.

Once you see it, you will learn it, and you will lose it once you learn it. Then learn it a few more times.

## Sharpen the knife process

> A workman must first sharpen his tools if he is to do his work well.The panel is the soul of the entire animation. If the panel is smooth, the mood will be good, and the animation will be handy, and the efficiency will be greatly improved. Although Bongo2.0 has a lot of tools, I feel that these three panels are commonly used.


#### 1、Timeline:Bongo/Timeline（√）
#### 2、Bongo:properties panel/Right click/Bongo （√）/Move to the far left
#### 3、Properties:Propertiese Panel/Bongo

（With these three panels, general animatino is not a problem）

**4、The range of the time slider:**   （Usually set to about 50 frames）
* Select the start end of the time slider, right click/start position/stop position/Enter
* Use the mouse wheel to zoom, drag the start and end ends, and click to reset the timeline view to quickly rest
